# Sign-Language-Numbers-Detection-using-HGR-and-CNN
In this project I created a Hand Gesture Model (HGR) to detect the hand gesture and match it with the sign language number. The algorithm I used is CNN and was saved in a Keras model. In this project I used OpenCV-Python, NumPy, Keras, and Python.
