# Sign-Language-Numbers-Detection-using-HGR-and-CNN
This is my Final Year Project for my bachelor degree in Computer Science. I created a Hand Gesture Model (HGR) to detect the hand gesture and match it with the sign language number. The algorithm I used is CNN and was saved in a Keras model. In this project I used OpenCV-Python, NumPy, Keras, and Python.

The aim for this project is to faciliate the communication barrier between deaf-community and hearing people and enable those deaf-community to engage more in the society with many promising opportunities for them.

One of the challenges I faced while working on this Computer Vision project is my laptop. My laptop is very old with no GPU, however I tried my best to make a computer vision project with whatever capabilities my laptop could offer. Even thuough this project looks very simple, but once it will be upgraded it will definatelly be a great project.

I am upgrading to a desktop PC now with advanced GPU, so I will be updating this project to include OpenPose, pytorch and more advanced deep learning tools.
